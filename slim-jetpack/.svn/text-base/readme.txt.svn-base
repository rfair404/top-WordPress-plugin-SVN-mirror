Slim version of Jetpack unlinked from WordPress.com :)
Supercharge your self-hosted wp site even you're NOT WP.COM users.

== Description ==

[Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/) is an awesome plugin bundle provided by the
Automattic but it requires WordPress.com account
even for those modules previously work as independent plugins. The marketing
banners are very obtrusive too.

I smashed the bundle to remove the annoying parts and keep the awesomeness.
Slim Jetpack will track the updates of Jetpack modules,
but is definitely INCOMPATIBLE with its original version because a lot of API
functions had been mocked or removed.

All credit goes to original developers @
[Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/developers/)!

Slimpack 2.1.1.x is corresponding to Jetpack 2.1.1 and the x is the bugfix mark.

If you need the wordpress.com stats, subscription and push notification
services etc., please deactivate Slim Jetpack
and use the original Jetpack instead.

== Screenshots ==
Here is the screen shot after Slim Jetpack activation.

== Installation ==

1. Install Slim Jetpack either via the WordPress.org plugin directory
   or by uploading the files to your server
2. Go to Settings-->Slim Jetpack and activate the modules you need. Configure
them if the 'configure' buttons appear.
   Click 'toggle' to show the 'deactivate' button and the infinite-scroll
module is only for twenty-xxx series themes,
   you may extend it to support your own themes.
3. That's it.  You're ready to go!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How many files are touched? Use a comparing tool to find out. But as I
remember, the list is:

Modified: jetpack.php(->slimjetpack.php), modules/module-info.php and
_inc/jetpack.js

Removed: files and folders of all removed modules

Not all abandoned blocks are removed from jetpack.php which might cause
problems but if it works,just ignore them :-)

I believe the functions I touched won't cause security issues, but use at your
own risk!

If you don't like certain modules, just delete them :-)

If you need a new module from Jetpack future releases, copy the files into
Slim Jetpack and try.

It should work without problem :)
